## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

The this project is centered arount the NestJS `backend` app, with a choice of 3 different frontend options available for example.
The intention is that only one of these would be selected when building your full-stack app.

- `backend`: a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) app with multiple entrypoints
  - Check out the [Backend Project Docs](apps/backend/README.md) for more detailed information.
- `web-static`: a [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) app
- `web-ssr`: a [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) app with server-side rendering (SSR)
- `web-next`: a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) app
  - The NextJS App is set up to provide the frontend features only, with the `backend` app serving providing `tRPC` a API and data persistence. 


### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

This starter kit is using turborepo and yarn workspaces for monorepo workflow.

### Prerequisites

- Install nps by running

```
npm i -g nps
```

- Make sure docker and docker-compose are
  installed. Refer to docs for your operating system.

### Configure Environment

- Frontend
  - `cd apps/web && cp .env.example .env`
  - `cd apps/web-ssr && cp .env.example .env`
- Backend
  - `cd apps/backend && cp .env.example .env`

### Install Dependencies

You can install the monorepo dependencies with:
```
yarn install
```

## Backend Entrypoints

The NestJS backend has multiple entrypoints, each serving different purposes:

### API Server (`entrypoints/api`)
- REST API with Swagger documentation
- tRPC endpoints for type-safe client communication
- Runs on port 5002
- Start with: `yarn dev:api` or `yarn start:api`

### Static React Server (`entrypoints/reactStatic`)
- Serves the React SPA as static files
- Includes tRPC endpoints for data fetching
- Basic setup for serving static content
- Runs on port 3000
- Start with: `yarn dev:react-static` or `yarn start:react-static`

### SSR React Server (`entrypoints/reactSSR`)
- Full server-side rendering for React
- Streams rendered HTML to client
- Hydrates into interactive app
- Includes tRPC endpoints
- Configurable server-to-client data passing
- Interactive shell for debugging and development
- Start with: `yarn dev:react-ssr` or `yarn start:react-ssr`

### REPL (`entrypoints/repl`)
- Interactive shell for debugging and development
- Direct access to NestJS dependency injection container
- Useful for testing services and repositories
- Start with: `yarn dev:repl` or `yarn start:repl`

Each entrypoint uses the same core NestJS modules but configures them differently based on its needs.

## Deployment

A dockerfile is included to help build and deploy the full-stack React SSR + Nest app.
